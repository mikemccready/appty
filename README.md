#Appty

Appty is a one touch appointment booking app designed to be user friendly.
Simply Sign Up/ Sign in via your Google account and authorize Appty to access your Google Calendar.
Users are able to add their regular providers, if listed on the app, visualize the appointements available and book it on one click.
Providers can list their available slots time to customers, by entering 'appty' on their own calendar, no need to login through the app anymore. The title will change to the customer name once booked.
